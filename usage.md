- I want to come up with a Software as a service application borrowing ideas from the attached python script. For a start, we shall start with posting to a facebook page and to a twitter account.

The idea is to use AI to do thorough marketing of behalf of subscribing organisations.

I want you to apply the best priciples for designing a world class software as a service application.

There will be a owner user who will have overall rights of the whole system including any permision to execute anything on any organisation.

- At minimum the user should be able to register for an organisation. At least the user should input, name of the organisation, description of the oganisation,contact person name, contact person phone number, contact person email. Add any other field that is necesary.When creating the organisation, we should generate a unique number for the organisation.

- The person who registers the organisation aumatically becomes the super admin of the organisation.

- Super admin has all the permissions to operate an organisation.

- A super admin of an organisation can do the following:
 1. Create a company for the organisation. An organisation can have many companies
 2. Create an admin for the company. An admin has all the permissions required to manage a company and all its operations including users
 3. Add any other necessary functionality that could be executed by the super admin

 - Once a super admin creates a company and the company admin, the company will create a social media manager 

 - Social media manager can do the following.
  1. Add a product to market
  - a product can have a name, description, price, discount, running/active offers etc . We can use a different table to save details like running offers.
  - apply the best practice for designing this considering a product may have different offers running at different times same to discounts.
  2. Add marketing topics and images(max of 3 images for each topic). A product will have active marketing topics. The social media manager can activate or deactivate a marketing topic.Go through this point and make the neccessary adjustments to enhance efficiency and scalability of the same.Add any neccesary field.

   - A marketing topic will have an expiring time after which the topic will be inactive. 
   - A social media manager can adjust all the settings of an active marketing topic.
   - A social media manager, can adjust the length of the message that will be sent to facebook.
   - When creating a marketing topic, the social media manager can optionally input hashtags to be sent to either the facebook page message or to the twitter account.
   - The social media manage can decide if the system will append the trending hashtags on twitter or not.
   - Social media manager will be able to dictate how many times and the time the marketing post will be posted to either twitter and facebook

- Use the best practices, to design and implement this system.
- The system should be very secure since it will be holding very sensitive data.
- Use role and permission based authorisation. 

- Technology to use
- Golang
- Best golang framework to handle this
- Any suitable golang library as needed
- The application will heavily rely of kafka mesaging system. Apply Kafka's best practices and utilize any necesary kafka feature.
- Use Mongodb database
- We can use redis of inter memory caching.

- Use multitenancy architecture
- We could use go routines where necesary


Make the code DRY(Dont repeat yourself)


We shall develop the front end dashboard using the following technologies.
- React JS
- Tailwind css
- Any other suitable library

- The front end dashboard should have a very modern look and be visually attractive
- The front end dashboard should strictly follow the mobile first principle. Every page should be very responsive.


Product name: Product X
To ship product X to customers/users, we would need to come up with the following.
1. Landing page design
2. Web app design
3. Intenal dashboard design
4. Mobile app design

After the designs have been reviewed and approaved. We shall proceed to
- Design and develop the backend API service.
- Develop the frontend app and integrate it with the backend
- Develop the landing page
- Develop the mobile application.
- Develop the internal dashboard for reporting.
- Deploy to the cloud. Either AWS, GCP etc.

Things to consider:
- Security
- Scalability
- Reliability/fault torelance
- User Experience.

Timelines:- to be issued by the onwer of the application
